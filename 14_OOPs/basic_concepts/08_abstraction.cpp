// Abstraction = Implementation Hiding

/*
Advantages of Abstraction :
- Only you can make changes to your data or function, and no one else can.
- It makes the application secure by not allowing anyone else to see the background details.
- Increases the reusabilty of the code.
- Avoids duplication of your code
